Oracle in a blockchain world - service or a weay to get rreal world info onto the blockhain and make it usable in smart contracts.

Utxo will be sitting at oracle address, als oracle has value with provided data (datum).
Validation only happens when you want to consume something from a script address, not when you produce an output at a script address.
We can't prevent nobody from producing arbitary outputs at the same oracle script address.
We need the way to distinguish the true UTxO oracle outut from other UTxOs at the same script address.
